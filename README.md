# User Twitter Info App

### This is an express web app that allows users to enter a twitter handle and recieve data about the user's page.

This is primarly done as an in order to learn about creating express applications using various APIs, in this case Twitter specifically. The home page as the main app page, but on the /signup page, I have a basic account creation field that writes the username and password data to the json file in the views folder called loginInfo.json. Right now it has no functionality other than the basic file write system.

## Instructions

#### 1. Run the app.js file with node.js
#### 2. Go to localhost:3000 (for the signup page go to localhost:3000/signup)
#### 3. Enter any relevant data that the page asks you and that's it!
